# BCOG-FINAL-PROJECT
Topic: Monopoly\
Our program is a simple simulator of the board game "Monopoly." Monopoly is an economic-themed broad game, and players will roll dice to make decisions and move on the board, such as purchasing land, paying rent, or having special events. Finally, the player with the most money will win the game and lose when the player goes bankrupt. 

Function A:\
This is the main function that allows players to choose the action term by term. 

Function B:\
We will have a class map that includes the land price/ rent and special events.
