**Test Case**
Testing our program is straightforward. First of all, user need to set the value of the player_num variable to be **greater than 1 and,less than 4** (easier to make verification).

Once the game starts, users can manually interact with the interface to verify key functions, including:

Rolling dice and moving the player

Buying land

Selling land 

Turn rotation through the take_turn()

Chance cards and handling their effects

These interactions can be used to verify that the game's logic, data handling, and GUI features.
